Here is a professionally structured `README.md` file that explains how to **connect Postman to an MCP server using a file import**, along with how to set up the server (`main.py`) and test it using Postman.

# 🔗 Connect Postman with MCP Server via File Import

This guide walks you through the complete process of:
- Importing MCP requests into Postman via a file
- Setting up your MCP server with tools
- Testing MCP server functionality using Postman

---

## 📥 Step 1: Open Postman

Launch Postman on your system.

---

## 📂 Step 2: Import MCP Collection

1. Click the **"Import"** button in the top-left corner of Postman.
2. Drag and drop your MCP request file (e.g., `hello_mcp_server.postman_collection.json`) into the import window.
3. Click **"Import"** to load the collection.

✅ The MCP server collection will now appear in your Postman workspace.

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Setup `main.py` for MCP Server

Create a new Python file named `main.py` and paste the following code:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.types import TextContent

# Initialize FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP(
    name="hello-server",
    stateless_http=True
)

# Example tool 1: Search online
@mcp.tool()
def search_online(query: str) -> str:
    return f"""Results for {query}..."""

# Example tool 2: Get weather
@mcp.tool()
async def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"""Weather in {city} is sunny."""

# Create the FastAPI-compatible app
mcp_app = mcp.streamable_http_app()
````

💡 This file defines two sample tools (`search_online` and `get_weather`) that can be tested via Postman.

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Start / Restart MCP Server

Make sure you're in the project folder and have MCP dependencies installed. Then run:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:mcp_app --port 8000 --reload
```

This command will launch the MCP server on:

```
http://localhost:8000/mcp/
```

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Test in Postman

1. In your imported Postman collection, select the request named **"List Available Tools"**.
2. Make sure:

   * **Method** = POST
   * **URL** = `http://localhost:8000/mcp/`
3. Click **Send**

🔎 You should see a list of available tools:

* `search_online`
* `get_weather`

---

## 🧪 Optional: Test a Tool Execution

To execute a tool from Postman, use the following body in a new POST request to `/mcp/`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/execute",
  "id": 2,
  "params": {
    "tool_name": "get_weather",
    "input": {
      "city": "Karachi"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure your MCP server is running before sending requests.
* Update your tool names and parameters in the request body according to your server logic.
* Use `@mcp.tool()` to register new tools.

---

## 📁 File Structure (Recommended)

```
your_project/
├── main.py
├── hello_mcp_server.postman_collection.json
└── requirements.txt
```

---

## 📞 Support

For issues, check:

* Server logs in the terminal
* JSON formatting errors in Postman
* Port conflicts or firewall issues

---

```

Let me know if you'd like the Postman collection `.json` file template or a zip of the project.
