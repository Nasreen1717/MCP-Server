### 4. Configure Headers

Go to the **Headers** tab and add the following:

| Key     | Value                      |
|---------|----------------------------|
| Accept  | application/json, text/event-stream |
| Content-Type | application/json      |

"method": "tools/list",
"id": 1,
"params": {}
}
````

### 6. Send the Request

Click **Send** to make the request to the MCP server.

If everything is configured correctly, youâ€™ll receive a list of available tools from the MCP server in the response body.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

* Make sure your server is running before sending the request.
* You can test other methods by changing the `"method"` and `"params"` in the request body.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example: Request to Execute a Tool

Hereâ€™s an example body to call a custom tool (replace `your_tool_name` and `your_params` accordingly):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/execute",
  "id": 2,
  "params": {
    "tool_name": "your_tool_name",
    "input": {
      "param1": "value1"
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you face any issues connecting, ensure:

* MCP server is running on the correct port
* No firewalls or proxies are blocking `localhost`
* JSON formatting is valid
